Inspired by the Advanced Calculus for Financial Engineering Applications seminar at Baruch College but more.

## Encapsulation of Plain Vanilla European Options
Using Black-Scholes model to evaluate the following for plain vanilla European options.
The Greeks are not implemented in the most efficient way, but in the most straightforward manner. 
Performance optimization is possible by taking into account the repeated computation of parameters d1 and d2, and the cumulative probability thereof.

For call options
```python
# N(x)
#      = norm.cdf(x)
# d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r - q + 1 / 2 * sigma ** 2) * T) / (sigma * sqrt(T))
# d2 = (ln(S/K) + (r - q - 1 / 2 * sigma ** 2) * T) / (sigma * sqrt(T))


# European call options using Black-Scholes formula
# premium = S * e ** (-q * T) * N(d1) - K * e ** (-r * T) * N(d2) 
```

## Bond Math
Based on time to maturity, coupon period, coupon rate, and bond value to compute the bond yield to maturity, duration, and convexity
